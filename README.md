## Before You Begin
Before you begin, we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble this website:
### Before making PR things to be check
- Get pull from the master to resolve conflicts if there
- Get pull from dev to resolve conflicts if there
- Don't make PR direct to the production branch(master), instead make PR to development branch(dev)
- After making PR wait and check, do all checks passed, and PR built successfully on Deployment Server
### For Project setup
- You can download this repo and run it locally but Don't put it on your GitHub.
- Download the repo and make a new branch (the name should be related to the feature you are working on). Then after making code changes push it on the Spardha repo and make pr.
- Don't make any changes on master (locally also). Whatever you want to do, make a new branch for that.
- all branches after your PR Accept/Reject are automatically deleted.
- all PR would be made on the dev branch, not to the direct master.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
- Git - Download & Install Git. OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.

  ```
- Create a .env file in the current directory of the project using the touch command in your terminal
- ```bash
  touch .env
  ```
- Get the .env variables' names from the .env.example file and paste them into the .env file
- Remember to paste all the values into the .env file
- To run the react - app, run the following command
- ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- The server will listen on PORT 3000 ( localhost:3000 )

### Get started with Backend


### Working with repo:
1. Clone the repo in which you must work in your system.
2. Create or do your work in another branch with a relevant name.
3. After completing your work, commit your changes and push them.
4. Create a pull request (PR).

### Setting up the project(Backend) :

1. Creating a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
2. Activate a virtual environment

Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
Windows:
```cmd
./venv/Scripts/activate
```
3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Move to the main folder: 
```bash
cd Spardha
```
5. Apply migrations: 
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
6. Collect static files : 
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```
7. Start the development server: 
```bash
